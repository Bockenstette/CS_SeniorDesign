In regards to the social requirement, our project is aimed at enhancing the quality of life of people. The core aim of the application is to aid people in organizing and managing their personal belongings. With people continuing to amass many belonings, trying to keep trac ow hat is actualy owned becomes difficult. By creating an application to address this issue, two positive outcomes are obtained. First, the outcome of being being aware of what one owns for reasons such as insurance in cases of damage or theft, and also when moving. Secondly, it will aid in helping people to not make duplicate purchases when they are unsure if they already own something or not.

Our project has a direct impact on our professional development, but not necessarily a direct impact on our public reputation.  Any skills that we learn while working on our project help us develop professionally.  The public reputation of the group members will most likely not be affected unless we decide to create a mobile app and/or distribute our application outside of our team.  Two major parts of our project include a database and a user interface.  Therefore, at least one of our team members will need to have knowledge of database design and development.  Also, someone will need to have an understanding of user interfaces and implementing a good user experience.
