Each day has such a long worktime simply because of the nature 
of when I worked. Combine that with the fact that I had those
days off in the afternoon to work, and I decided that simply
working on the project like a job was the best option. The
23rd was spent mostly getting the project up and running with
its own environment and the different technologies I used.
After that was just straight coding and debugging for a few
days untill I got a good prototype to really start deployment
testing. The 28th I tried setting up a 3rd party webhost for
out app through Google Web Services and Amazon Web Services,
neither of which panned out and caused a lot of headache with
their installers sometimes just refusing to work correctly.
After trashing that idea in favor of just using localhost,
the remaning few days were polishing and cleaning up the
code to a respectable state.
