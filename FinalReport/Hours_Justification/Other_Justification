While Kevin had kept exact record his time worked, the rest of us had no such records for time spent coding. This was due to some large sessions, but many small sessions of just doing it between other things. 
All other hours recorded in the table that are not coding are accurate and were written down (just as numbers, no notes since we were bad at taking notes at meetings or for other things.)
