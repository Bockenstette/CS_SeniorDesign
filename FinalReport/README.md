## Abstract
KRAM (our application) is the ability to store everything you own. The vision we have is for you to be able to “cram” all of your possessions into our app for easy ordering and searching, as well as trying to remember where you stored things if you so choose. Not only that, the record of your possessions our app will produce can provide insurance assistance. We want to allow people to grab control of their lives through control of their possessions, and KRAM sets out to do just that. The program was created in such a way to allow deployment in browser or on any mobile device. Users are able to enter, edit/maintain, and delete items from their personal database. The app allows for multiple users without overlapping or being able to access another’s data. The app is simple and intuitive to use and works effectively and without any significant issues.

## Project Description 
Our project was to create an inventory management application for people to use to keep track of their belongings. A user is able manually enter what they own into a database along with appropriate metadata for indexing. Searches could then be done on the database to quickly find any possessions for reference. This application could also be used to help with recovering assets lost in a disaster such as a fire or tornado. This project was coded using Ionic, Angular, Flask, Python, and MySQL. Future work is to include the ability to attach pictures to items and custom field support.

## User Interface Specifications
The user interface was made with Ionic and Angular. The design is based on being simple yet powerful. Each page only shows the necessary info in a nice looking format. The Login page can open either the create new account page or the main page. The main page can access every other page from there.
