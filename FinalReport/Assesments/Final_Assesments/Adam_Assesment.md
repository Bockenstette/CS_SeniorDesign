I had several contributions to this project. The first was that our project idea was one that I personally came up with. Another was acting as team leader (and primary communicator between people). Third was helping wherever I could with coding. Finally, I also was the primary tester/bug-finder of our project. I was able to apply skills from my job (leadership, testing) to this project.

 I learned about being better about communicating and time-management. My personal success was being able to get successfully get a group of people to work together, despite issues, to finish this project. The biggest obstacle was time-management and not always making sure everyone was doing what they should in order to hit our deliverable deadlines. Other obstacles included us being unfamiliar with most of the technology we were using, and also losing a month of work time because we all focused on other classes in January.
