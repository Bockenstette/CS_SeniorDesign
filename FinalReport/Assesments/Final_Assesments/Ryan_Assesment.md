My Individual contribution to this project was the creation and most of the features of the front end, the entirety of the backend API, and the database.  I built upon many of my skills in web development and API development during this project.  Database development was new to me but fairly easy.

I created the front end using Nodejs, Angular 2 framework, and Ionic framework.  These frameworks we're used in the development of the front end and all its features.  To create the backend I used Python with flask and pymysql creating several POSTs and a few GETs.  For the database I use MySQL can create a simple script to build the schema. I learned a lot more about MySQL and flask, along with that ionic framework which showed me how easy it is to create universal mobile applications.
