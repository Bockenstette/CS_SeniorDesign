	My contribution to the project was the back-end API and database. I do not fully remember the
skills I listed last fall, but I am believing that I listed working with a web service and working with a
database. Or maybe it was something more generic, I cannot recall at this time. But provided those
were the skills, then I certainly learned more about those skills. I learned more about the various calls
HTTPS makes across the web and how they work. I learned how to set up a restful service for making
calls to and how to connect that to a database to make queries to. 

	I learned a great deal about how useful web services are and how they can be used to properly
handle the input of multiple different sources. I also learned that I am not the best at managing my
time. I had too much of a crunch time near the end of the project and have since realized the flaws in
letting that kind of situation arise. My obstacles were numerous. Trying to set up a 3rd party hosting
service failed on all levels. Even Googleâ€™s web services failed on installation that I could not figure out
why. Eventually simply setting up a local service was decided on but trying to get the big name hosting
services to work was a challenge. Also simply learning how to properly code a web service was
difficult as I have never worked with something of that sort before.
