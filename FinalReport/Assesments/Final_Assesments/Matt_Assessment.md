I worked on the front-end of KRAM, an inventory management application.  I implemented around half of the front-end features including the side menu, the popover menu, and the search box.  Another one of my contributions was the logo.  In my initial assessment, I mentioned that we would utilize our skills of programming and teamwork.  Both of these were applied, challenged, and built up.  We used Ionic and Angular for the front-end, neither of which I had ever used before.  Also, the teamwork was difficult at times, but we were able to work through it.
 
One of the things I learned over the course of this project is that communication is one of the most important aspects of teamwork.  I also learned how to use Ionic and Angular, which utilizes Typescript.  I now have somewhat of a competency in these technologies.  Some of my successes included getting the search box to function correctly and getting the popover menu to work.  The popover menu was such a big deal to me because one of my other group members couldnâ€™t get it to work when he tried, and I figured it out.  The obstacles I ran into included a learning curve since we were using technologies I had never seen before, as well as a lot of last minute work because of a mishap with the back-end.
