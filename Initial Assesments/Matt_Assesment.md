The Senior Design project is the culmination of everything we've done while at UC.  It is a combination of all our coursework and
co-op experience.  We will be able to apply skills such as programming and teamwork.  This project will allow us to demonstrate
how well we communicate with others and can work together.  It will also let us prove we can work on a timeline and finish on time.
The result of this project will represent the result of our UC education.

There are two courses that taught me the most: CS 4092 - Database Design and Development and EECE 3093C - Software Engineering.
In Database Design, we learned about database structures and how to query data.  Both of these have been useful already while on
co-op, but will also be a huge part of this project.  Software Engineering taught me about software development life cycles,
requirement analysis, and other knowledge of software development.  We worked in teams for the lab assignments in Software Engineering,
so I gained experience working with others, while also accounting for deadlines.  These are not the only two classes that I learned
important knowledge in, but they stick out because of how much I learned while taking them.  The database knowledge and teamwork
experience will be great assets while working on this project.

My first two co-op terms I worked as a Software Development Co-op at International TechneGroup Inc.  While working there, I learned
Python and improved my self-confidence in the workplace.  I also worked on my public speaking as I had to give status updates on my
project at the weekly team meeting.  My last three co-op terms were spent working at Matson Money.  At Matson, I have been both a
Quality Assurance Analyst Co-op and a Software Development Co-op.  Working at Matson has allowed me to improve many of my skills
including finding bugs, writing C#/.NET code, and developing under the Agile methodology.  Nothing compares to having real world
experience, and that experience will guide me in everything I do over the course of this project.

One motivation for working on this project is that I should be able to use the end product myself.  That was one reason my group went
with the inventory app idea is because it is something we will actually be able to use when all is said and done.  I am excited to
work on this project because it will show what I have learned over the course of my time at UC.  It also means that I am one step closer
to going out into the real world to continually apply the knowledge I have acquired over the last five years.  The preliminary approach
is to develop a basic desktop application that can store items.  After that, we hope to improve the user interface and migrate the
functionality to a mobile application.

The expected result is that a user will be able to input and save an item to the database.  They should also be able to search the
database and get that item back.  You could test these somewhat at the same time.  If you save an item, search for it and see if
it is returned.  We will know we are done if items can be saved and returned successfully.  If the application is easy for users to
figure out and use, then we will know for sure that we have done a good job.
