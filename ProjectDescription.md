Project Background Description
</h3>
Our project is to create an inventory management application for people to use to keep track of their
belongings. A user will be able to take a picture of something they own and enter it into a database
along with appropriate metadata for indexing. Searches could then be done on the database to quickly
find any possesions for reference. This application could also be used to help with recovering
assets lost in a disaster such as a fire or tornado.

<h3>
Project Problem Statement
</h3>
Most people do not keep track of every item they own, and if anything should happen to it, they would
be hard pressed to accurately recall everything lost. On top of that, it is hard to remember what you
own at all times, allowing the possibility of buying something twice to occur.

<h3>
Inadequecy of Current Solution
</h3>
After searching there appears to be no personal inventory manager. All variations we could find
were aimed towards businesses keeping track of their stock by scanning barcodes or similar ideas.
Our plan for a personal inventory manager does not seem to have any actual implementation, to our
suprise.

<h3>
Background Skills
</h3>
All four group members are Computer Science majors, so we all have experience with working with software.
We will be able to work our way through a database and the UX that will allow our app to be easy to use and
helpful.

<h3>
Approach
</h3>
Our initial approach is 3-fold.
* Create a reliable input system for inputing entries into the database
* Create a database, either local or cloud based, to handle the indexing/searching of the application
* Refine the UX to a point where the application is easy and enjoyable to use

OPTIONAL FEATURE
* Implement image recognition to allow application to recognize what object is photographed without
  the user manually inputting the metadata

Expectations for final product/demo
* A workable inventory
* Fast searching of inventory
* Responsive and easy to use UI
* Overall pleasant UX
